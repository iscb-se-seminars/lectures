# ISCB Southeast USA Seminar Series

The ISCB Southeast Regional Chapter seminar series highlights computational biology research across the southeastern United States, while actively fostering a supportive and inclusive community for trainees. Through this series, we aim to empower the next generation of students and postdoctoral scholars by providing exposure to diverse scientific perspectives, career paths, and role models across academia, industry, and research institutes. By lowering barriers to access, promoting diversity in speakers and participants, and encouraging open dialogue, the series facilitates meaningful knowledge transfer, mentorship, and professional development, strengthening the regional computational biology ecosystem and its future leaders.
